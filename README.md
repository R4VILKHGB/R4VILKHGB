# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ravil

## Computer Science Graduate | Software Developer | Data Scientist
I'm a computer science graduate from the University of British Columbia with a strong passion for AI, data analysis, and UI/UX design. My work focuses on building user-centric software that blends innovation with functionality. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in data analysis, web development, and designâ€”both through academic projects and real-world applications.

One of my most impactful experiences was contributing to **Spacey's (Stratospheric Polarization Analysis for Calculating Electromagnetic Yaw)** as part of the CAN-SBX 2023â€“2024 Canadian Stratospheric Balloon Experiment Design Challenge. Our team developed a unique payload to be launched into the stratosphere, where I engineered a system using a Raspberry Pi Pico to track payload rotation via electromagnetic fieldsâ€”successfully tested during our launch on June 24 at the Timmins Victor M. Power Airport. This project was supported by CEDS-EEDS Canada and the Canadian Space Agency.

Currently, I work part-time at a private company, where I design and develop software solutions. One of the projects I built for the companyâ€”a bookkeeping and calendar application using Qtâ€”is available on my GitHub as a personal showcase.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in deep learning, data analysis, and UI/UX design.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring advanced AI and creative applications of machine learning.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™ve been drawing since I could hold a pencilâ€”charcoal is my favorite medium. I also enjoy digital design and am proficient in Adobe Photoshop.

## Projects

### [Spacey's Blog](https://spaceys.blog/) 
Official UBCO team for CAN-SBX 2023â€“2024. I led software development for our stratospheric payload, building the microcontroller software architecture in Python and creating a custom program to track and adjust the ground station antenna orientation post-launch.

### AIDE
AI-powered platform built to streamline grading in web development courses. As part of a six-person capstone team, I co-developed AIDE using a microservices architecture (React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database). We implemented Docker for containerization and Drone CI for seamless deployment. AIDE automates grading of HTML/CSS/JS and weblink submissions and provides personalized feedback to students.

### [Fujitsubame Finance Dashboard](https://github.com/R4VILKHGB/fujitsubame-finance-dashboard) 
A Qt-based desktop finance dashboard built for Fuji Tsubame Co., Ltd. to manage partner companies and contractual revenues. Fully localized, offline-capable, and designed with a clean QML/C++ architecture. Shared here as a showcase of production-level application development.
