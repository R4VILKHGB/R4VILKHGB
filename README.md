# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ravil

## Computer Science Student at UBC
I'm a dedicated and driven computer science student at the University of British Columbia, currently in my final year. I'm interested in AI, data analysis, and UI/UX design, crafting user-centric solutions with a focus on innovation and value. I have practical experience in data analysis, UI/UX design, and web development. I'm eager to expand my knowledge and skills in AI, particularly deep learning, striving to enhance my expertise. 

I'm currently working on a project called **Spacey's (Stratospheric Polarization Analysis for Calculating Electromagnetic Yaw)**, as part of the CAN-SBX 2023-2024/ Canadian Stratospheric Balloon Experiment Design Challenge from UBC Okanagan.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in deep learning, data analysis, and UI/ UX design. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer vision and microcontroller programming (particularly utilizing Thonny and Raspberry Pi Pico).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm passionate about drawing, both in traditional (particularly with charcoal) and digital mediums. My keen eye for design has been a defining trait since childhood. I'm proficient in Adobe Photoshop, showcasing my dedication and skill in image manipulation and graphic design.

## Projects

I'm designing the software architecture for the microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico) that will be inside the payload of the stratospheric balloon, utilizing Python.
